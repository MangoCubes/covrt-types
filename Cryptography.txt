Notation:
 - V: Vault
 - C: Container
 - G: Group
 - U: User
 - I: Item
 - F: Field
   - V1: Instance of a vault
 - Sym: Symmetric key
   - Dec: Decryption key, only generated from user secrets and is never sent to server
 - Pub/Priv: Public/Private key
   - U1.Sym: Symmetric key of user 1
 - Ver: Verification key, only generated from user secrets and sent to server to authenticate
 - SE(Data, *.Sym): Symmetric encryption
 - AE(Data, *.Pub): Asymmetric encryption

General specifications
 - A vault has no cryptographical features, and only serves to group multiple groups and containers
 - A container has one symmetric key that allows access to it, and can decrypt a key pair associated with it
   - Same goes for a group and each user
 - An item has a symmetric key that can decrypt it
 - A field is encrypted with the item key it is part of

Constraints
 - A vault must have at least one group and at least one container
 - A group or a container can only be associated with only one vault
 - A container must be associated with at least one group

Cryptography:
 - Registration
   - U1 generates the following locally:
     - U1.Ver
     - U1.Dec
     - U1.Sym
     - U1.Pub/Priv
   - U1 sends the following to the server:
     - Email
     - U1.Ver
     - U1.Pub
     - SE(U1.Sym, U1.Dec)
     - SE(U1.Priv, U1.Sym)
 - Creating a vault
   - U1 generates the following locally:
     - C1.Sym
